Due Date:  7/7
Purpose:

The objective of this task is to enhance your proficiency in implementing coding logic that involves with arithmetic. This exercise will provide you with an opportunity to develop your skills in structuring program that calculates various statistics based on user input.

 
Task:

You're developing a statistics calculator for a sports team. The program prompts the user to input scores for three games, each between 0 and 100. It then calculates the average score based on these inputs. Implement a threshold of 70 to determine whether the average score qualifies as a top performance. Display the calculated average score and indicate whether the player is classified as a top performer.

Pseudocode

    Display the name of this application (Game Statistics Calculator) to the webpage
    Get 1st game score (0-100) from the user and store in a variable
    Get 2nd game score (0-100) from the user and store in a variable
    Get 3rd game score (0-100) from the user and store in a variable
    Calculate the average of the 3 game scores.
    Set the threshold to 70 and store in a variable
    Determine if the the average meets the threshold and display the average score number to one decimal point.
